# Additional Bars
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NlvU7Va.png"></p>


This mod adds additional bars to the game that go along with Iron Bars!

Goal of this mod is to add more options when it comes to bars blocks, because having just iron bars as option is sometimes dull. This mod adds bars block for gold, every wood type and a lot more to come!

It features Horizontal Bars for every type of bars!

Currently, this mod has compatibility with Biomes o' Plenty and Corail Woodcutter.
